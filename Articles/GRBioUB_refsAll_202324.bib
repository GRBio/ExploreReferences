   abstract = {In multivariate analysis, the measures of similarity and distance characterize the analogies and differences between objects. Based on the distances, a medoids test uses diversity to characterize the variabilities between and within groups. To reduce the distorting effect of outlier populations, we propose an alternative based on medians. To be precise, the medoid of each group has been related to the object that minimizes the median of the distances to the other members of the group, and the diversity within each group has been related to the median of the distances to the medoid. In this context, the distribution of the ratio of the diversities (between and within groups) is obtained by the method of permutations. The results obtained in a simulation study of a prospective character have established that, in the presence of outlier populations, the test based on medians provides a greater adherence to the level of significance (α= 0.05 ) than the test based on means.},

   abstract = {Weed control is one of the major challenges in rice cultivation, and the use of agrochemicals for this crop is severely restricted under the new European agricultural policy. Therefore, new effective non-chemical weed control techniques are the key to sustain European rice production. We investigated four non-chemical weed management strategies in the Ebro Delta in north-eastern Spain, two in dry-seeded rice fields and two in water-seeded rice fields. In addition, two controls per sowing condition were included: a positive control consisting of chemical herbicides treatment and a negative control consisting of no weeding and no seeding. Mechanical weeding using a rotary harrow placed in front of the seeder was the best weeding technique for dry seeding, while ‘stale seed bed’ and transplanting was the best performing technique for wet seeding. Both techniques were as effective as the chemical weeding control, reducing the density of weeds and the supplementary manual weeding time needed for those weed species more abundant in Ebro Delta rice fields (i.e., Echinochloa oryzoides, Echinochloa crus-galli, Bolboschoenus maritimus and Heteranthera reniformis). Thus, non-chemical weeding alternatives have been proven effective for both, transplanting and dry seeding field management strategies.},

This research has been carried out according to a non-experimental design, with quantitative nature and framed within ex post facto studies, in 6 virtual classrooms with 340 students. A cluster analysis with K-means method provides three groups which, in turn, let us identify three student profiles: efficient, dedicated and passive. These profiles are comparable to previous findings regarding participation and behaviour patterns in participants in MOOCs with similar characteristics to the participants in the present study. The results of this study validate the fundamental role that time and evaluation design play in the students’ learning strategies and stimulate the redesign of the course, especially the activities oriented to better achievement of passive students.},

To gain insight into this topic, analyses of Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) from Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice were carried out. Methods: Histopathological analysis by electron and optical microscopy in DRG samples, and mRNA expression analyzes by the microarray technique in DRG and blood leukocyte samples from NOD and C57BL/6 mice were performed. Results: The results showed the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in DRG cells early in life that could be related to a neurodegenerative process. In view of these results, mRNA expression analyses were conducted to determine the cause and/or the molecules involved in this suspected disorder. The results showed that DRG cells from NOD mice have alterations in the transcription of a wide range of genes, which explain the previously observed alterations. In addition, differences in the transcription genes in white blood cells were also detected. Discussion: Taken together, these results indicate that functional defects are not only seen in beta cells but also in DRG in NOD mice. These results also indicate that these defects are not a consequence of the autoimmune process that takes place in NOD mice and suggest that they may be involved as triggers for its development.},

We will show that the relation between both types of changes can be attributed to the unveiled genetic changes being compatible with the adaptation of Drosophila subobscura populations to warmer climates. The climate data are the monthly average temperatures of various populations in Europe and America at two different time periods separated by about 25 years. The genetic data include different profiles of Drosophila subobscura chromo-somal polymorphisms that, as shown in the scientific literature, are related to the adaptation of the species to different climates.

   abstract = {<p>Around 50 years ago, molecular biology opened the path to understand changes in forms, adaptations, complexity, or the basis of human diseases through myriads of reports on gene birth, gene duplication, gene expression regulation, and splicing regulation, among other relevant mechanisms behind gene function. Here, with the advent of big data and artificial intelligence (AI), we focus on an elusive and intriguing mechanism of gene function regulation, RNA editing, in which a single nucleotide from an RNA molecule is changed, with a remarkable impact in the increase of the complexity of the transcriptome and proteome. We present a new generation approach to assess the functional conservation of the RNA-editing targeting mechanism using two AI learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) neural networks with an attention layer. These algorithms, combined with RNA-editing data coming from databases and variant calling from same-individual RNA and DNA-seq experiments from different species, allowed us to predict RNA-editing events using both primary sequence and secondary structure. Then, we devised a method for assessing conservation or divergence in the molecular mechanisms of editing completely in silico: the cross-testing analysis. This novel method not only helps to understand the conservation of the editing mechanism through evolution but could set the basis for achieving a better understanding of the adenosine-targeting mechanism in other fields.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: Breast milk is a complex and dynamic fluid needed for infant development and protection due to its content of bioactive factors such as immunoglobulins (Igs). Most studies focus primarily on IgA, but other types of Ig and even other immune components (cytokines and adipokines) may also play significant roles in neonatal health. As a first step, we aimed to characterize the Ig profile, many cytokines, and two adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) at two sampling time points within the transitional stage, which is the least studied phase in terms of these components. The secondary objective was to identify different breast milk immunotypes in the MAMI cohort substudy, and finally, we further aimed at analyzing maternal and infant characteristics to identify influencing factors of breast milk immune composition. Methods: Breast milk samples from 75 mothers were studied between days 7 and 15 postpartum. The Igs, cytokines, and adipokine levels were determined by a multiplex approach, except for the IgA, IgM, and leptin that were evaluated by ELISA. Results: IgA, IgM, IgE, IgG2, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 were significantly higher on day 7 with respect to day 15. The multiple factor analysis (MFA) allowed us to identify two maternal clusters (immunotypes) depending on the breast milk immune profile evolution from day 7 to day 15, mainly due to the IgE and IgG subtypes, but not for IgA and IgM, which always presented higher levels early in time. Conclusion: All these results demonstrated the importance of the dynamics of the breast milk composition in terms of immune factors because even in the same lactation stage, a difference of 1 week has induced changes in the breast milk immune profile. Moreover, this immune profile does not evolve in the same way for all women. The dynamic compositional changes may be maternal-specific, as we observed differences in parity and exclusive breastfeeding between the two BM immunotype groups, which could potentially impact infant health.},

The diagnosis of atherosclerosis in the context of a high body mass index (BMI) can be challenging, making the identification of biomarkers clinically relevant.

This prospective observational study included 61 participants undergoing bariatric surgery for SO, defined as a BMI >40 kg/m2 or >35 kg/m2 with at least one comorbidity. Atherosclerotic plaques were detected by ultrasound. Plasma samples were obtained 1 month before and at 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery to measure irisin by ELISA. Additionally, subcutaneous samples of adipose tissue were taken and genotyped to identify irisin polymorphism rs3480. Irisin levels were positively correlated with BMI (r = 0.23, p = 0.0064), negatively correlated with atheroma-related parameters (e.g., carotid intima-media thickness), and lower in subjects with atheroma (p < 0.0002). Irisin also showed good overall accuracy for discriminating plaque presence (AUC, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.6956–0.9156). However, the rs3480 polymorphism correlated with neither the irisin levels nor the presence of atheromas.

   abstract = {Global warming is an environmental phenomenon to which species must adapt to survive. Drosophila subobscura presents an adaptive capacity due to its chromosomal inversion polymorphism. Until now, the impact of global warming on this polymorphism has been studied in D. subobscura populations located either on a continental mainland or on islands not far from a continent. In this context, gene flow could be a relevant mechanism allowing the movement of thermally adapted inversions between populations. Our aim was to sample and study the chromosomal polymorphism on Madeira, a small isolated island in the Atlantic Ocean. We compared our findings with those reported in the same location approximately four and five decades ago. Moreover, we studied whether global warming has occurred on this island by analyzing mean, maximum and minimum temperatures over a 55-year period. All atmospheric parameters have increased significantly, consistent with climate change expectations. Frequencies and chromosomal thermal index values of thermal adapted inversions remained quite stable over years. Furthermore, J, U and O chromosomes are almost fixed for “warm” adapted inversions. Thus, if there is little genetic variability remaining and temperatures continue increasing, island populations of D. subobscura might be on the threshold of endangerment. However, apart from selection, genetic drift and inbreeding, other processes, such as phenotypic plasticity or thermoregulatory behavior, could be involved in the survival of the species’ populations. Finally, although in danger, D. subobscura is a generalist that lives in humanized environments, and this fact could favor its persistence on Madeira Island.},

   abstract = {Background: Obesity is a polygenic multifactorial disease. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several common loci associated with obesity-related phenotypes. Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective long-term treatment for patients with severe obesity. The huge variability in BS outcomes between patients suggests a moderating effect of several factors, including the genetic architecture of the patients. Objective: To examine the role of a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 7 polymorphisms in 5 obesity-candidate genes (FTO, MC4R, SIRT1, LEP, and LEPR) on weight loss after BS. Setting: University hospital in Spain. Methods: We evaluated a cohort of 104 patients with severe obesity submitted to BS (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) followed up for >60 months (lost to follow-up, 19.23%). A GRS was calculated for each patient, considering the number of carried risk alleles for the analyzed genes. During the postoperative period, the percentage of excess weight loss total weight loss and changes in body mass index were evaluated. Generalized estimating equation models were used for the prospective analysis of the variation of these variables in relation to the GRS. Results: The longitudinal model showed a significant effect of the GRS on the percentage of excess weight loss (P = 1.5 × 10–5), percentage of total weight loss (P = 3.1 × 10–8), and change in body mass index (P = 7.8 × 10–16) over time. Individuals with a low GRS seemed to experience better outcomes at 24 and 60 months after surgery than those with a higher GRS. Conclusion: The use of the GRS in considering the polygenic nature of obesity seems to be a useful tool to better understand the outcome of patients with obesity after BS.},

   abstract = {RBFOX1 functions as a master regulator of thousands of genes, exerting a pleiotropic effect on numerous neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. A potential mechanism by which RBFOX1 may impact these disorders is through its modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission, a common target for pharmacological intervention in psychiatric conditions linked to RBFOX1. However, the precise effects of RBFOX1 on the serotonergic system remain largely unexplored. Here we show that homozygous rbfox1sa15940 zebrafish, which express a shorter, aberrant rbfox1 mRNA, have significantly reduced serotonin levels in telencephalon and diencephalon. We observed that the acute administration of fluoxetine partially reverses the associated behavioural alterations. The hyperactive phenotype and altered shoaling behaviour of the rbfox1sa15940/sa15940 zebrafish could be reversed with acute fluoxetine exposure in the Open Field and the Shoaling test, respectively. However, in the other paradigms, hyperactivity was not diminished, suggesting a distinct intrinsic motivation for locomotion in the different paradigms. Acute fluoxetine exposure did not reverse the alterations observed in the aggression and social novelty tests, suggesting the involvement of other neurological mechanisms in these behaviours. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the intricate working mechanisms of RBFOX1 in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders to gain a better understanding of the associated disorders along with their pharmacological treatment.},

   abstract = {Supervised and unsupervised classification is crucial in many areas where different types of data sets are common, such as biology, medicine, or industry, among others. A key consideration is that some units are more typical of the group they belong to than others. For this reason, fuzzy classification approaches are necessary. In this paper, a fuzzy supervised classification method, which is based on the construction of prototypes, is proposed. The method obtains the prototypes from an objective function that includes label information and a distance-based depth function. It works with any distance and it can deal with data sets of a wide nature variety. It can further be applied to data sets where the use of Euclidean distance is not suitable and to high-dimensional data (data sets in which the number of features p is larger than the number of observations n, often written as p>>n). In addition, the model can also cope with unsupervised classification, thus becoming an interesting alternative to other fuzzy clustering methods. With synthetic data sets along with high-dimensional real biomedical and industrial data sets, we demonstrate the good performance of the supervised and unsupervised fuzzy proposed procedures.},

   abstract = {The adaptive value of the Drosophila subobscura chromosomal inversion polymorphism with regard to environmental effects is well-known. However, the specific details of the inversion adaptations to the global warming scenario deserve to be analyzed. Toward this aim, polymorphism and karyotypes were studied in 574 individuals from Petnica (Serbia) in annual samples taken in June for the period 2019–2022. Comparing the results of Petnica (Cfa: humid subtropical climate) with those from Avala (Serbia: Cfb, temperate oceanic climate) and Font Groga (Barcelona, Spain; Csa: hot-summer Mediterranean climate), significant differences were observed for their chromosomal polymorphism. In Petnica, inversions from U and E chromosomes mainly reacted significantly with regard to temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Moreover, the inversion polymorphism from Petnica (2019–2022) was compared with that from 1995. In this period, a significant increase in mean and maximum temperature was observed. However, to properly explain the observed variations of inversions over time, it was necessary to carefully analyze annual seasonal changes and particular heat wave episodes. Interestingly, yearly fluctuations of U chromosome ‘warm’-adapted inversions corresponded with opposite changes in ‘non-thermal’ inversions. Perhaps these types of inversions were not correctly defined with regard to thermal adaptation, or these fluctuations were also due to adaptations to other physical and/or biological variables. Finally, a joint study of chromosomal inversion polymorphism from many Balkan populations of D. subobscura indicated that different climatic regions presented distinct composition, including thermal-adapted inversions.},

   abstract = {Objective  The aim of the study is to compare the duration of oxygen therapy by using two methods of weaning from nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in very preterm babies. Study Design  Between April 2014 and December 2016, 90 preterm <32 weeks and birthweight >1,000 g who, after at least 7 days on nCPAP, were clinically stable on <6 cm H 2O and FiO 2<30% were randomly assigned to weaning directly from nCPAP or with nasal high flow therapy (nHFT). In the nCPAP group, pressure was gradually reduced until the infant was stable on 4 cm H 2O and then discontinued. In the nHFT group, flow rate was reduced until the infant was stable at 3.l pm and then discontinued. Results  Eighty-four infants completed the study. There were no differences between the groups for the primary outcome, duration of oxygen therapy (median 33 [14-48] versus 28 [15-37] days; p = 0.17). The incidence of moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia was similar. Weaning time was shorter in the nCPAP group (p = 0.02), but the failure rate was slightly higher although non-significant. In the nHFT group, we observed better perception of patient comfort and a lower incidence of severe nasal injury. Conclusion  Weaning by nHFT compared with weaning directly off nCPAP does not prolong duration of oxygen therapy. Rather, it is associated with better perceptions of infant comfort among parents and lower rates of severe nasal injury. Key Points Nasal high-flow therapy is commonly used in most neonatal intensive care unit for nCPAP weaning. Weaning by nHFT does not increase the duration of oxygen therapy. nHFT use improves the perception of infant comfort among parents.},

   abstract = {Platform trials bring the promise of making clinical research more efficient and more patient centric. While their use has become more widespread, including their prominent role during the COVID-19 pandemic response, broader adoption of platform trials has been limited by the lack of experience and tools to navigate the critical upfront planning required to launch such collaborative studies. The European Union-Patient-cEntric clinicAl tRial pLatform (EU-PEARL) initiative has produced new methodologies to expand the use of platform trials with an overarching infrastructure and services embedded into Integrated Research Platforms (IRPs), in collaboration with patient representatives and through consultation with U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency stakeholders. In this narrative review, we discuss the outlook for platform trials in Europe, including challenges related to infrastructure, design, adaptations, data sharing and regulation. Documents derived from the EU-PEARL project, alongside a literature search including PubMed and relevant grey literature (e.g., guidance from regulatory agencies and health technology agencies) were used as sources for a multi-stage collaborative process through which the 10 more important points based on lessons drawn from the EU-PEARL project were developed and summarised as guidance for the setup of platform trials. We conclude that early involvement of critical stakeholder such as regulatory agencies or patients are critical steps in the implementation and later acceptance of platform trials. Addressing these gaps will be critical for attaining the full potential of platform trials for patients.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The time taken to achieve blood pressure (BP) control could be pivotal in the benefits of reducing BP in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aimed to assess the relationship between the rapid achievement and sustained maintenance of an intensive systolic BP (SBP) target with radiologic, clinical, and functional outcomes. METHODS: Rapid, Intensive, and Sustained BP lowering in Acute ICH (RAINS) was a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients with ICH <6 hours and SBP ≥150 mm Hg at 4 Comprehensive Stroke Centers during a 4.5-year period. Patients underwent baseline and 24-hour CT scans and 24-hour noninvasive BP monitoring. BP was managed under a rapid (target achievement ≤60 minutes), intensive (target SBP <140 mm Hg), and sustained (target stability for 24 hours) BP protocol. SBP target achievement ≤60 minutes and 24-hour SBP variability were recorded. Outcomes included hematoma expansion (>6 mL or >33%) at 24 hours (primary outcome), early neurologic deterioration (END, 24-hour increase in NIH Stroke Scale score ≥4), and 90-day ordinal modified Rankin scale (mRS) score. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, anticoagulation, onset-to-imaging time, ICH volume, and intraventricular extension. RESULTS: We included 312 patients (mean age 70.2 ± 13.3 years, 202 [64.7%] male). Hematoma expansion occurred in 70/274 (25.6%) patients, END in 58/291 (19.9%), and the median 90-day mRS score was 4 (interquartile range, 2-5). SBP target achievement ≤60 minutes (178/312 [57.1%]) associated with a lower risk of hematoma expansion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.77), lower END rate (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.80), and lower 90-day mRS scores (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.74). The mean 24-hour SBP variability was 21.0 ± 7.6 mm Hg. Higher 24-hour SBP variability was not related to expansion (aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.04) but associated with higher END rate (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21) and 90-day mRS scores (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.10). DISCUSSION: Among patients with acute ICH, achieving an intensive SBP target within 60 minutes was associated with lower hematoma expansion risk. Rapid SBP reduction and stable sustention within 24 hours were related to improved clinical and functional outcomes. These findings warrant the design of randomized clinical trials examining the impact of effectively achieving rapid, intensive, and sustained BP control on hematoma expansion. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in adults with spontaneous ICH and initial SBP ≥150 mm Hg, lowering SBP to <140 mm Hg within the first hour and maintaining this for 24 hours is associated with decreased hematoma expansion.},

   abstract = {Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It is affecting the entire planet. Despite the widespread use of ecologic analysis in epidemiologic research and health planning, health scientists and practitioners have given little attention to the methodological aspects of this approach. The study of risk factors linked to the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most current and exciting topics for epidemiologists. These risks in many cases are unknown. This research covers the study of risk factors in the case of COVID-19 and proposes the use of an ecologic method known to epidemiologists in the case of aggregated data. The present study aims to compute a model that allows to easily calculate the risk of infection in different types of populations, using aggregated data to approximate the individual risk of COVID-19 transmission by a person. Methods: The case of Catalonia, in Spain, is presented as an example, as it is one of the areas where the incidence of the virus among the population is being higher. The proposed method is known as an ecological study and is based on the statistical regression model between the incidence (or variable that represents it) and the risk factors but using aggregated data and obtaining a risk ratio (RR). Results: The results obtained have made it possible to find the risk of contracting COVID-19 concerning risk factors for high family income (RR=1.157491), more mobility (RR=1.065475), and high density of population (1.00002). Conclusions: This method could be used to design an app that predicts how the risk will evolve and calculate the risk of contagion in one area or another to take the proper action. The calculated RR can help us to understand how the variables become risks or protective factors at an ecological level (understanding aggregate data).},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact. Knowing the variables that affect the increase in infection is crucial for public health decision-making. Mobility and socio-demographic conditions of the population are important factors in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between people mobility, social determinants of health and COVID-19 cases using a Random Forest (RF) method. Methods: The COVID-19 cases were analyzed in the Maule Region, Chile. Spearman rank was performed to analyze the total mobility index for each municipality. RF regression was used to create a model between COVID-19 infections, mobility index and sociodemographic variables. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Total mobility was highly correlated with new COVID-19 cases, adjusted for total population, in each municipality (í µí½: 0.52-0.92). An upward trend is observed for mobility and COVID-19 cases for the 30 municipalities analyzed. For the RF model, COVID-19 active cases, total mobility, and external mobility are obtained as VIM. The most relevant demographic variables were overcrowding, density and area of municipality. The R-Squared was 0.68 for the performed RF model. Conclusions: Artificial Intelligence methodologies are increasingly used for their excellent performance. RF Regression offers a clear solution for the design of predictor variables on the number of new cases per week. Mobility is a powerful predictor variable for the number of COVID-19 new cases.},

The current investigation of COVID-19 dynamics was carried at the Hospital Fundació Sant Joan de Deu de Martorell (FHSJDM). This research aims to analyse the COVID-19 time series in FHSJDM. Methods: The time series of COVID-19 were analized for 2020-2021. To measure seasonality, the Dicky-Fuller test was obtained. The analysis of the results was performed in R-Studio software. Results: Three peaks of cases are observed for January, April, and July 2021. These peaks of hospital cases are correlated with the new cases in the municipality and also with the new cases in Catalonia. The result of the seasonality test has a p-value >0.05, and thus it is accepted that the series is not seasonal for the registry of hospital cases. Discussion: The study of COVID-19 dynamics is relevant to preparing health services. Each peak observed in the 2021 period affected the health services in the hospital FHSJDM, having an increase for new cases, hospitalized patients and total cases for COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Précis: The manuscript evaluates cost-effectiveness of glaucoma screening with imaging devices and telemedicine based on a screening campaign performed in Spain. The screening strategy implemented in our analysis was cost-effective compared with opportunistic case finding. Introduction: Open angle glaucoma is an asymptomatic ocular disease that represents one of the first causes of blindness. Diagnosis is currently made by opportunistic case finding, usually by community optometrists or general ophthalmologists. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy based on optical coherence tomography and fundus photographs in glaucoma detection. Materials and Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out to compare 2 alternative strategies: opportunistic finding versus screening. A Markov tree model was carried out with 10 health states according to disease progression. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used as a measure of effectiveness. We included short-term and long-term direct health costs and a discount rate of 3%. We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and several 1-way sensitivity analyses. Results: The cohort in the screening program entailed an increase in 0.097 QALYs and additional costs of €1187 versus opportunistic finding, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of about €12.214/QALY. The 1-way sensitivity analysis showed that inputs related to age and screening program (cost and detection rate) were those most strongly influencing the results of the analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust to significant changes in the main variables of the analysis. Conclusions: The screening strategy implemented in our analysis was cost-effective compared with opportunistic finding in patients with glaucoma in this Spanish setting.},

   abstract = {Background: Inhalation of Legionella-containing aerosols generated by cooling towers (CT) and evaporative condensers (EC) where water risk management is not performed correctly has been linked to a high percentage of community outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease (LD). Likewise, microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of the water in these facilities have been associated with this bacterium. The main aim of this study was to assess the risk of Legionella colonization in CT and EC based on the data for microbiological and physicochemical water quality provided by the Environmental Health Department and Laboratory of the City Council of L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona, Spain). Methods: Legionella was analysed in 789 samples collected from 127 CT and EC in 46 companies in Catalonia from 2002 to 2019. A two-step logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the risk of colonization by Legionella in the studied facilities according to the microbiological (aerobic heterotrophic bacteria) and physicochemical (pH, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, conductivity, total iron and Langelier Index) water parameters. The optimal cut-off points for the water parameters predictive of Legionella contamination were defined as the values on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve where sensitivity and specificity were jointly maximized. Results: Legionella was isolated in 8.49% of the 789 analysed samples, 22.39% of which were heavily contaminated (with counts higher than 1.0 × 104 CFU/l). L. pneumophila was isolated in 82.09% of the samples, with 41.82% belonging to serogroup 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that aerobic heterotrophic bacteria concentrations ≥6.90 × 102 CFU/ml [Odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) = 3.56 (1.39–9.43), p = 0.01], a pH ≥ 8.70 [OR (95% CI) = 3.60 (1.34–10.09), p = 0.01], and water hardness ≥5.72 × 102 mg/l [OR (95% CI) = 6.30 (2.34–18.56), p < 0.001] were each independently associated with a higher risk of CT and EC colonization by Legionella. Conclusions: The present study shows the importance of risk assessment for improving the control measures aimed at preventing or reducing Legionella populations in CT and EC, thus minimizing potential dangers for public health.},

Cretaceous amber outcrops are more abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and during an interval of about 54 million years, from the Barremian to the Campanian. The extensive resin production that generated this remarkable amber record may be attributed to the biology of coniferous resin producers, the growth of resiniferous forests in proximity to transitional sedimentary environments, and the dynamics of climate during the Cretaceous. Here we discuss the set of interrelated abiotic and biotic factors potentially involved in resin production during that time. We name this period of mass resin production by conifers during the late Mesozoic, fundamental as an archive of terrestrial life, the ‘Cretaceous Resinous Interval’ (CREI).},

A pilot study of oral and faecal microbiota was proposed with 36 paediatric patients divided in three cohorts [12 with CD, 12 with UC and 12 healthy controls (HC)] with 6 months of follow-up. Finally, 30 participants were included: 13 with CD, 11 with UC and 8 HC (6 dropped out during follow-up). Despite the small size of the study population, a differential pattern of microbial biodiversity was observed between IBD patients and the control group. Twenty-one bacterial species were selected in function of their discriminant accuracy, forming three sets of potential markers of IBD. Although IBD diagnosis requires comprehensive medical evaluation, the findings of this study show that faecal metagenomics or a reduced set of bacterial markers could be useful as a non-invasive tool for an easier and earlier diagnosis.</p>},

   abstract = {Anthocyanins (ACNs) are (poly)phenols associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk. Associations between dietary intake, microbial metabolism, and cardiometabolic health benefits of ACNs have not been fully characterized. Our aims were to study the association between ACN intake, considering its dietary sources, and plasma metabolites, and to relate them with cardiometabolic risk factors in an observational study. A total of 1351 samples from 624 participants (55% female, mean age: 45 ± 12 years old) enrolled in the DCH-NG MAX study were studied using a targeted metabolomic analysis. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls were used to collect dietary data at baseline, six, and twelve months. ACN content of foods was calculated using Phenol Explorer and foods were categorized into food groups. The median intake of total ACNs was 1.6mg/day. Using mixed graphical models, ACNs from different foods showed specific associations with plasma metabolome biomarkers. Combining these results with censored regression analysis, metabolites associated with ACNs intake were: salsolinol sulfate, 4-methylcatechol sulfate, linoleoyl carnitine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and one valerolactone. Salsolinol sulfate and 4-methylcatechol sulfate, both related to the intake of ACNs mainly from berries, were inversely associated with visceral adipose tissue. In conclusion, plasma metabolome biomarkers of dietary ACNs depended on the dietary source and some of them, such as salsolinol sulfate and 4-methylcatechol sulfate may link berry intake with cardiometabolic health benefits.},

Methods: Data were collected through an anonymous, nationwide, and secure Internet survey with multiple built-in quality-assurance techniques that included the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire and an in-depth supplemental questionnaire. Key Results: The survey was completed by 2072 adult Spanish participants (50.2% female) with a mean age of 45.67 ± 15.44 years with a good representative national distribution. 43.6% (41.5%–45.8%) met diagnostic criteria for at least one DGBI, with 8.2% for any esophageal disorder, 12.1% for any gastroduodenal disorder, 30.1% for any bowel disorder, and 11.5% for any anorectal disorder. Functional constipation was the most prevalent DGBI in Spain (12.8%). We found that proctalgia fugax (9.3%), unspecified bowel disorders (10.8%), and functional dysphagia (5.6%) showed unexplained high rates in our country. DGBI rates were higher for women. Having any DGBI was negatively associated with psychosocial variables (including quality of life, somatization, and concern about digestive problems), and associated with increased healthcare utilization. Conclusions & Inferences: We provide the first comprehensive data on the prevalence and burden of all DGBI in Spain using the Rome IV criteria. The enormous burden of DGBI in Spain highlights the need for specialized training and future research.},

   abstract = {The main goals and challenges for the life science communities in the Open Science framework are to increase reuse and sustainability of data resources, software tools, and workflows, especially in large‐scale data‐driven research and computational analyses. Here, we present key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating and establishing sustainable life science resources based on the collaborative, cross‐disciplinary work done within the EOSC‐Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences) consortium. Bringing together 13 European life science research infrastructures, it has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational, technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC‐Life provides a model for sustainable data management according to FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles, including solutions for sensitive‐ and industry‐related resources, by means of cross‐disciplinary training and best practices sharing. Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.},

   abstract = {Background and ObjectivesTo identify biomarkers associated with treatment response in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with the oral therapies teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), and fingolimod.MethodsSerum levels of IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) IL-1β, and chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) were measured at baseline and 12 months with single molecule array (Simoa) assays in a cohort of patients with MS treated with teriflunomide (N = 19), DMF (N = 22), and fingolimod (N = 25) and classified into "no evidence of disease activity"(NEDA) and EDA patients after 1 year of treatment.ResultsSerum CXCL13 and TNF-α levels were significantly decreased after treatment with teriflunomide in NEDA compared with EDA patients after 1 year of treatment (p = 0.008 for both cytokines). These findings were validated in an independent cohort of patients with MS treated with teriflunomide (N = 36) and serum CXCL13, and TNF-α levels were again significantly reduced in NEDA patients (p < 0.0001 for CXCL13 and p = 0.003 for TNF-α). CXCL13, but not TNF-α, showed good performance to classify NEDA and EDA patients according to a cut-off value of 9.64 pg/mL based on the change in CXCL13 levels between baseline and 12 months, with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 82% in the original cohort, and sensitivity of 65.4% and specificity of 60% in the validation cohort.DiscussionAltogether, these results point to CXCL13 as a treatment response biomarker to teriflunomide in relapsing-remitting patients with MS, and the change in CXCL13 levels during the first year of treatment can be used in clinical practice to identify optimal responders to teriflunomide.},

   abstract = {Introduction: During the development of Autoimmune Diabetes (AD) an autoimmune attack against the Peripheral Nervous System occurs. To gain insight into this topic, analyses of Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) from Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice were carried out. Methods: Histopathological analysis by electron and optical microscopy in DRG samples, and mRNA expression analyzes by the microarray technique in DRG and blood leukocyte samples from NOD and C57BL/6 mice were performed. Results: The results showed the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in DRG cells early in life that could be related to a neurodegenerative process. In view of these results, mRNA expression analyses were conducted to determine the cause and/or the molecules involved in this suspected disorder. The results showed that DRG cells from NOD mice have alterations in the transcription of a wide range of genes, which explain the previously observed alterations. In addition, differences in the transcription genes in white blood cells were also detected. Discussion: Taken together, these results indicate that functional defects are not only seen in beta cells but also in DRG in NOD mice. These results also indicate that these defects are not a consequence of the autoimmune process that takes place in NOD mice and suggest that they may be involved as triggers for its development.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Little is known about the molecular profiling associated with the effect of cladribine in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we aimed first to characterize the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles induced by cladribine in blood cells, and second to identify potential treatment response biomarkers to cladribine in patients with MS. Methods: Gene, protein and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles were determined by microarrays (genes, miRNAs) and mass spectrometry (proteins) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MS patients after in vitro treatment with cladribine in its active and inactive forms. Two bioinformatics approaches to integrate the three obtained datasets were applied: (i) a multiomics discriminant analysis (DIABLO - Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies); and (ii) a multi-stage integration of features selected in differential expression analysis on each dataset and then merged. Selected molecules from the in vitro study were quantified by qPCR ex vivo in PBMCs from MS patients receiving cladribine. Results: PBMCs treated in vitro with cladribine were characterized by a major downregulation of gene, protein, and miRNA expression compared with the untreated cells. An intermediate pattern between the cladribine-treated and untreated conditions was observed in PBMCs treated with cladribine in its inactive form. The differential expression analysis of each dataset led to the identification of four genes and their encoded proteins, and twenty-two miRNAs regulating their expression, that were associated with cladribine treatment. Two of these genes (PPIF and NHLRC2), and three miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-30b-5p, and miR-30e-5p) were validated ex vivo in MS patients treated with cladribine. Discussion: By using a combination of omics data and bioinformatics approaches we were able to identify a multiomics molecular profile induced by cladribine in vitro in PBMCs. We also identified a number of biomarkers that were validated ex vivo in PBMCs from patients with MS treated with cladribine that have the potential to become treatment response biomarkers to this drug.},

The aim of the current study is to develop an MD- metabolomic score (MDMS) and investigate its association with CD in community-dwelling older adults. Methods and results: This study includes participants from the Three-City Study from the Bordeaux (n = 418) and Dijon (n = 422) cohorts who are free of dementia at baseline. Repeated measures of cognition over 12 years are collected. An MDMS is designed based on serum biomarkers related to MD key food groups and using a targeted metabolomics platform. Associations with CD are investigated through conditional logistic regression (matched on age, sex, and education level) in both sample sets. The MDMS is found to be inversely associated with CD (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.90 [0.80–1.00]; p = 0.048) in the Bordeaux (discovery) cohort. Results are comparable in the Dijon (validation) cohort, with a trend toward significance (OR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.83–1.01]; p = 0.084). Conclusions: A greater adherence to the MD, here assessed by a serum MDMS, is associated with lower odds of CD in older adults.},

Sharing these data for research can help address unmet health needs, contribute to scientific breakthroughs, accelerate the development of more effective treatments and inform public health policy. Due to the potential sensitivity of such data, however, privacy concerns have led to policies that restrict data sharing. In addition, sharing sensitive data requires a secure and robust infrastructure with appropriate storage solutions. Here, we examine and compare the centralized and federated data sharing models through the prism of five large-scale and real-world use cases of strategic significance within the European data sharing landscape: the French Health Data Hub, the BBMRI-ERIC Colorectal Cancer Cohort, the federated European Genome-phenome Archive, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership/OHDSI network and the EBRAINS Medical Informatics Platform. Our analysis indicates that centralized models facilitate data linkage, harmonization and interoperability, while federated models facilitate scaling up and legal compliance, as the data typically reside on the data generator’s premises, allowing for better control of how data are shared. This comparative study thus offers guidance on the selection of the most appropriate sharing strategy for sensitive datasets and provides key insights for informed decision-making in data sharing efforts.},

   abstract = {Biomarkers associated with dietary fibre intake, as complements to traditional dietary assessment tools, may improve the understanding of its role in human health. Our aim was to discover metabolite biomarkers related to dietary fibre intake and investigate their association with cardiometabolic risk factors. We used data and samples from the Danish Diet Cancer and Health Next Generation (DCH-NG) MAX-study, a one-year observational study with evaluations at baseline, six and 12 months (n = 624, 55% female, mean age: 43 years, 1353 observations). Direct associations between fibre intake and plasma concentrations of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,6-DHBA) and indolepropionic acid were observed at the three time-points. Both metabolites showed an intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.50 and were associated with the self-reported intake of wholegrain cereals, and of fruits and vegetables, respectively. Other metabolites associated with dietary fibre intake were linolenoyl carnitine, 2-aminophenol, 3,4-DHBA, and proline betaine. Based on the metabolites associated with dietary fibre intake we calculated predicted values of fibre intake using a multivariate, machine-learning algorithm. Metabolomics-based predicted fibre, but not self-reported fibre values, showed negative associations with cardiometabolic risk factors (i.e. high sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, all FDR-adjusted p-values <0.05). Furthermore, different correlations with gut microbiota composition were observed. In conclusion, 2,6-DHBA and indolepropionic acid in plasma may better link dietary fibre intake with its metabolic effects than self-reported values. These metabolites may represent a novel class of biomarkers reflecting both dietary exposure and host and/or gut microbiota characteristics providing a read-out that is differentially related to cardiometabolic risk.},

   abstract = {Stress exposure during the sensitive period of early development has been shown to program the brain and increases the risk to develop cognitive deficits later in life. We have shown earlier that early-life stress (ES) leads to cognitive decline at an adult age, associated with changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. In particular, ES has been shown to affect neurogenesis rate and the survival of newborn cells later in life as well as microglia, modulating their response to immune or metabolic challenges later in life. Both of these processes possibly contribute to the ES-induced cognitive deficits. Emerging evidence by us and others indicates that early nutritional interventions can protect against these ES-induced effects through nutritional programming. Based on human metabolomics studies, we identified various coffee-related metabolites to be part of a protective molecular signature against cognitive decline in humans. Caffeic and chlorogenic acids are coffee-polyphenols and have been described to have potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. Therefore, we here aimed to test whether supplementing caffeic and chlorogenic acids to the early diet could also protect against ES-induced cognitive deficits. We induced ES via the limited nesting and bedding paradigm in mice from postnatal(P) day 2–9. On P2, mice received a diet to which 0.02% chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) + 0.02% caffeic acid (3′,4′-dihydroxycinnamic acid) were added, or a control diet up until P42. At 4 months of age, all mice were subjected to a behavioral test battery and their brains were stained for markers for microglia and neurogenesis. We found that coffee polyphenols supplemented early in life protected against ES-induced cognitive deficits, potentially this is mediated by the survival of neurons or microglia, but possibly other mechanisms not studied here are mediating the effects. This study provides additional support for the potential of early nutritional interventions and highlights polyphenols as nutrients that can protect against cognitive decline, in particular for vulnerable populations exposed to ES.},

   abstract = {Background and purpose: The aim was to evaluate whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes defined by inflammation and neurodegeneration markers correlate with serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients; and to explore the role of radiological phenotypes and biomarker levels on treatment response and long-term prognostic outcomes. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging scans from 80 RRMS patients were classified at baseline of interferon-beta (IFNβ) treatment into radiological phenotypes defined by high and low inflammation and high and low neurodegeneration, based on the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, brain parenchymal fraction and the relative volume of non-enhancing black holes on T1-weighted images. Serum levels of NfL and GFAP were measured at baseline with single molecule array (Simoa) assays. MRI phenotypes and serum biomarker levels were investigated for their association with IFNβ response, and times to second-line therapies, secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) conversion and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 6.0. Results: Mean (SD) follow-up was 17 (2.9) years. Serum NfL levels and GFAP were higher in the high inflammation (p = 0.04) and high neurodegeneration phenotypes (p = 0.03), respectively. The high inflammation phenotype was associated with poor response to IFNβ treatment (p = 0.04) and with shorter time to second-line therapies (p = 0.04). In contrast, the high neurodegeneration phenotype was associated with shorter time to SPMS (p = 0.006) and a trend towards shorter time to EDSS 6.0 (p = 0.09). High serum NfL levels were associated with poor response to IFNβ treatment (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes defined by inflammation and neurodegeneration correlate with serum biomarker levels, and both have prognostic implications in treatment response and long-term disease outcomes.},

   abstract = {Hippocampal neurogenesis (HN) occurs throughout the life course and is important for memory and mood. Declining with age, HN plays a pivotal role in cognitive decline (CD), dementia, and late-life depression, such that altered HN could represent a neurobiological susceptibility to these conditions. Pertinently, dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet) and/or individual nutrients (e.g., vitamin D, omega 3) can modify HN, but also modify risk for CD, dementia, and depression. Therefore, the interaction between diet/nutrition and HN may alter risk trajectories for these ageing-related brain conditions. Using a subsample (n = 371) of the Three-City cohort—where older adults provided information on diet and blood biobanking at baseline and were assessed for CD, dementia, and depressive symptomatology across 12 years—we tested for interactions between food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional biomarker concentrations and neurogenesis-centred susceptibility status (defined by baseline readouts of hippocampal progenitor cell integrity, cell death, and differentiation) on CD, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular and other dementias (VoD), and depressive symptomatology, using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models. Increased plasma lycopene concentrations (OR [95% CI] = 1.07 [1.01, 1.14]), higher red meat (OR [95% CI] = 1.10 [1.03, 1.19]), and lower poultry consumption (OR [95% CI] = 0.93 [0.87, 0.99]) were associated with an increased risk for AD in individuals with a neurogenesis-centred susceptibility. Increased vitamin D consumption (OR [95% CI] = 1.05 [1.01, 1.11]) and plasma γ -tocopherol concentrations (OR [95% CI] = 1.08 [1.01, 1.18]) were associated with increased risk for VoD and depressive symptomatology, respectively, but only in susceptible individuals. This research highlights an important role for diet/nutrition in modifying dementia and depression risk in individuals with a neurogenesis-centred susceptibility.},
